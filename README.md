# hosebox

An inventory-management web application designed for the "Meadow Lane: Magic the Gathering" (MLMTG) league.

Unlike other deck management sites, hosebox has a host of wonderful features that it provides, alongide its fellow robot (and best pal in the world...), hosebot.


## Features
That's right, folks -- hosebox and hosebot are teaming up, allowing MLMTG Wizards to...
- Create and manage decklists, sideboards, and scratchpads, all free of charge.
- Manage privacy for each individual decklist, allowing Wizards to display public decks (e.g. playoff lists) while leaving the rest of their decks safe from Goose and Gavin's prying eyes. Massively, this removes the need to maintain multiple deckbox accounts and inventories.
- Generate random reward (!reward) cards/packs via Discord (!reward), post those rewards, then have those rewards auto-added to the correct wizard's inventory.
- Initiate trades via Discord (!trade), generate/post correct trade image, then auto-update both wizard's inventories to reflect the trade.
- Submit decklists via Discord (!submit), taking each wizard's OFFICIAL DECKLIST and emailing it to the official MLMTG email account for record-keeping. No more late decklists!
- View the current season's MLMTG schedules, records, and standings.

## To-Do
- [ ] make the to-do list lol
